// Hello!!

// 🏃‍♂️ There is a 100m foot-race of SOC bootcampers
// Each day of the race, the number of seconds by which the winner won is recorded
// e.g Day 1 [6]
// However, the number of races which occur in a day increase by 1 daily
// e.g. Day 4 [2, 9, 2, 7]
// At the end of the week, Chris takes in all the records in one big array..
// 🤦‍♂️ .. but realises a whole day is missing and that all the days have been muddled up!
// e.g. [[4, 4], [6], [1, 6, 2, 7, 3], [2, 9, 2, 7],] --- The missing day here is 3

// 📖 Your task is to find the missing day❗

// Note 1 👀: If the array of arrays is empty or null, you should return a 0.
// Note 2 👀: When there is an array in the array that is null or empty, you should also return a 0.
// Note 3 👀: There will always be a missing array

// Bonus ⭐: Throw an error with a message "Empty input detected" when there's nothing entered

export function findTheMissingDay(arrayOfArrays) {
  return 0;
}
