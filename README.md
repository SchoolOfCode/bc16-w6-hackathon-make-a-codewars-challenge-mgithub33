# Find the missing day!

After collecting results from the past n days, Chris has lost a record for for one of the days and the rest got jumbled out of chronological order in respect to their days ❗❗

## 💡 OBJECTIVES FOR THE KATA

🏃‍♂️ There is a 100m foot-race of SOC bootcampers

Each day of the race, the number of seconds by which the winner won is recorded
e.g Day 1 [6]

However, the number of races which occur in a day increase by 1 daily
e.g. Day 4 [2, 9, 2, 7]

🤦‍♂️ At the end of the week, Chris takes in all the records in one big array..
.. but realises a whole day is missing and that all the days have been muddled up!
e.g. [[4, 4], [6], [1, 6, 2, 7, 3], [2, 9, 2, 7],] --- The missing day here is 3
